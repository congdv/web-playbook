# Javascript

## Promise

"A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future"

A promise has 3 states:
- Fulfilled: onFulfilled() will be called (resolve() was called)
- Rejected: onRejected() will be called -> reject() was called
- Pending: not yet fulfilled or rejected

## Closure
"A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state( the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
